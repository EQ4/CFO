Great tutorial :)

Only a few comments:

At the moment it kinda looks like the text is belonging to the picture above, rather than the picture below. I lean towards text (captions) sitting under the picture as we are used to this from articles, etc.

In terms of the height of the 100nF cap and LEDs, it's better if they are added after the thumbwheel, IC socket and mini jacks.
